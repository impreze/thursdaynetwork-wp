                <h3>Public Relations</h3>
                <p>Being the nation’s premier young professional group rings hollow unless the rest of the world knows it. That said, the Public Relations Committee informs local and national communities about Thursday Network’s activities and initiatives. In addition to maintaining internal communications and web site information, the committee also serves as the initial contact between the Thursday Network and various philanthropic individuals and groups, partnering organizations, and media sources. In a world that often judges by appearance, and not substance, the Public Relations Committee ensures that the Thursday Networks image coincides with its character.</p>

                <p>The Public Relations committee promotes the events and activities of Thursday Network through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn social media outlets. Additionally, all newsletter communications, press releases, and web site maintenance is executed by this committee. The Public Relations committee offers members the opportunity to develop and/or sharpen their communications skills and assist Thursday Network in spreading the word about our impact in the metropolitan DC area.</p>

                <h3>Social and Cultural</h3>
                <p>All work and no play leads to a listless young professional. Luckily, however, the Social and Cultural (S&C) Committee is here to satisfy all of our culture-tainment needs. Whether through monthly events, such as theatrical/dance performances, museum tours, and ethnic dining, or seasonal events, such as ski weekends, summer cookouts, and holiday socials, the S&C Committee strives to enhance the camaraderie of the Thursday Network.</p>

                <p>This committee allows members the opportunity to showcase their creative event planning and execution skills by organizing and implementing socially and culturally diverse events.</p>
